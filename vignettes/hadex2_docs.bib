	abstract = {Measurement of residual structure in intrinsically disordered proteins can provide insights into the mechanisms by which such proteins undergo coupled binding and folding. The present work describes an approach to measure residual structure in disordered proteins using millisecond hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in a conventional bottom-up peptide-based workflow. We used the exchange mid-point, relative to a totally deuterated control, to quantify the rate of H/D exchange in each peptide. A weighted residue-by-residue average of these midpoints was used to map the extent of residual structure at near single-residue resolution. We validated this approach both by simulating a disordered protein and experimentally using the p300 binding domain of ACTR, a model disordered protein already well-characterized by other approaches. Secondary structure elements mapped in the present work are in good agreement with prior nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The new approach was somewhat limited by a loss of spatial resolution and subject to artifacts because of heterogeneities in intrinsic exchange. Approaches to correct these limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {With the advent of fully automated sample preparation robots for Hydrogen–Deuterium eXchange coupled to Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), this method has become paramount for ligand binding or epitope mapping screening, both in academic research and biopharmaceutical industries. However, bridging the gap between commercial HDX-MS software (for raw data interpretation) and molecular viewers (to map experiment results onto a 3D structure for biological interpretation) remains laborious and requires simple but sometimes limiting coding skills. We solved this bottleneck by developing HDX-Viewer, an open-source web-based application that facilitates and quickens HDX-MS data analysis. This user-friendly application automatically incorporates HDX-MS data from a custom template or commercial HDX-MS software in PDB files, and uploads them to an online 3D molecular viewer, thereby facilitating their visualization and biological interpretation.The HDX-Viewer web application is released under the CeCILL (http://www.cecill.info) and GNU LGPL licenses and can be found at https://masstools.ipbs.fr/hdx-viewer. The source code is available at https://github.com/david-bouyssie/hdx-viewer.},

	abstract = {Differential hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry (HX-MS) measurements are valuable for identification of differences in the higher order structures of proteins. Typically, the data sets are large with many differential HX values corresponding to many peptides monitored at several labeling times. To eliminate subjectivity and reliably identify significant differences in HX-MS measurements, a statistical analysis approach is needed. In this work, we performed null HX-MS measurements (i.e., no meaningful differences) on maltose binding protein and infliximab, a monoclonal antibody, to evaluate the reliability of different statistical analysis approaches. Null measurements are useful for directly evaluating the risk (i.e., falsely classifying a difference as significant) and power (i.e., failing to classify a true difference as significant) associated with different statistical analysis approaches. With null measurements, we identified weaknesses in the approaches commonly used. Individual tests of significance were prone to false positives due to the problem of multiple comparisons. Incorporation of Bonferroni correction led to unacceptably large limits of detection, severely decreasing the power. Analysis methods using a globally estimated significance limit also led to an overestimation of the limit of detection, leading to a loss of power. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid statistical analysis, based on volcano plots, that combines individual significance testing with an estimated global significance limit, that simultaneously decreased the risk of false positives and retained superior power. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of null HX-MS measurements to explicitly evaluate the criteria used to classify a difference in HX as significant.},

	abstract = {The function, efficacy, and safety of protein biopharmaceuticals are tied to their three-dimensional structure. The analysis and verification of this higher-order structure are critical in demonstrating manufacturing consistency and in establishing the absence of structural changes in response to changes in production. It is, therefore, essential to have reliable, high-resolution and high sensitivity biophysical tools capable of interrogating protein structure and conformation. Here, we demonstrate the use of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS) in biopharmaceutical comparability studies. H/DX-MS measurements can be conducted with good precision, consume only picomoles of protein, interrogate nearly the entire molecule with peptide level resolution, and can be completed in a few days. Structural comparability or lack of comparability was monitored for different preparations of interferon-β-1a. We present specific graphical formats for the display of H/DX-MS data that aid in rapidly making both the qualitative (visual) and quantitative assessment of comparability. H/DX-MS is capable of making significant contributions in biopharmaceutical characterization by providing more informative and confidant comparability assessments of protein higher-order structures than are currently available within the biopharmaceutical industry.},

One of the distinctive features of higher eukaryotes is the existence of stable multi-protein complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and translation elongation factors. Here, we report a quaternary organization of the human guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex, eEF1B, comprising α, β and γ subunits that specifically associate into a heterotrimeric form eEF1B(αβγ)3. As both the eEF1Bα and eEF1Bβ proteins have structurally conserved GEF domains, their total number within the complex is equal to six. Such, so far, unique structural assembly of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factors within a stable complex may be considered as a ‘GEF hub’ that ensures efficient maintenance of the translationally active GTP-bound conformation of eEF1A in higher eukaryotes.},

Quantitative differences in the amount of hydrogen exchange between two states (i.e., differential HX) are taken as evidence of significant differences in higher-order structure or dynamics. The quantitative measures range from simple mass differences at one HX labeling time to differences averaged across an HX time course with correction for deuterium recovery. This work applies the principles of uncertainty propagation to differential HX measurements to facilitate the identification of significant differences. Furthermore, it is shown that pooled estimates of experimental uncertainty result in a lower false positive rate than estimates of uncertainty based on individual standard deviations.},
