# Importing data

``` r
library(HaDeX)
```

Although the HaDeX application accepts only csv file exported from
DynamX in `cluster` format, it is not impossible to use HaDeX package
with other formats. Here, we present a little guide to mocking data.

In this article, we focus on processing on the file so it could be
accepted into HaDeX workflow. We do not discuss the content of the file,
without minor comment addressing already calculated uptake data.

*Keep in mind that this guide is based on the limited amount of file
types from popular vendors. As there are many formats and local custom
in labeling the data, this article should be treated as a hint how to
start, and not finite tutorial. The user needs to be careful and react
accordingly. In case of any doubt, feel free to contact us, we will be
glad to help!*

The best way to check if the file is suitable for the application is
load in (using e.q. web-server) and see the file status. If the file is
in wrong format, there should be appropriate message.

The main function for data import is
[`HaDeX::read_hdx()`](https://hadexversum.github.io/HaDeX2/reference/read_hdx.md)
function.

## DynamX cluster file

This is the preferable file format, that does not need any processing.
The required columns are:

    #>  [1] "Protein"      "Start"        "End"          "Sequence"     "Modification"
    #>  [6] "Fragment"     "MaxUptake"    "MHP"          "State"        "Exposure"    
    #> [11] "File"         "z"            "RT"           "Inten"        "Center"

If the file have all required columns, it should be accepted by the
[`HaDeX::read_hdx()`](https://hadexversum.github.io/HaDeX2/reference/read_hdx.md)
function.

## DynamX state file

If the user already have an exported file from DynamX in `state` format,
we assume they have an access to DynamX and we recommend them to export
file in `cluster` format to avoid any data processing. However, if this
is impossible, we present how to mock missing information.

    #>  [1] "Protein"      "Start"        "End"          "Sequence"     "Modification"
    #>  [6] "Fragment"     "MaxUptake"    "MHP"          "State"        "Exposure"    
    #> [11] "Center"       "Center SD"    "Uptake"       "Uptake SD"    "RT"          
    #> [16] "RT SD"

To go from here to desired format, there are some action needed:

``` r

dat <- read.csv(datafile)

dat %>%
    # mock columns
    mutate(z = 1, 
           Inten = 1, 
           File = "")
    # exclude unused columns
    select(-Uptake, -`Uptake SD`, -`Center SD`, -`RT SD`)
```

Then, save the file and use it in the application.

Other way is to use already made uptake calculations and use the uptake
data directly in the workflow:

``` r

kin_dat <- dat %>%
    # select only one state 
    # exclude measurement without calculated uptake
    filter(State == state,
           !is.na(Uptake)) %>%
    # rename to used convention 
    rename(deut_uptake = Uptake,
           err_deut_uptake = `Uptake SD`) %>%
    # exclude unused columns
    select(-Center, -`Center SD`, -RT, -`RT SD`, -Fragment)
```

This way we have uptake calculated in Daltons. If there is FD (labeled
with $Exposure$ value), here is how to normalize uptake with respect to
selected measurement:

``` r

# select FD based on Exposure in time_100
fd_dat <- filter(kin_dat, Exposure == time_100) %>%
    arrange(Start, End) %>%
    mutate(ID = 1:nrow(.))

# normalize the uptake data and calculate uncertainty
  kin_dat <- merge(kin_dat, fd_dat,
               by = c("Protein", "Start", "End", "Sequence", "Modification", "MaxUptake", "MHP", "State"),
               suffixes = c("", "_fd")) %>%
    mutate(frac_deut_uptake = deut_uptake/deut_uptake_fd,
           err_frac_deut_uptake = sqrt((err_deut_uptake/deut_uptake_fd)^2 + (deut_uptake*err_deut_uptake_fd/deut_uptake_fd^2)^2)) %>%
    select(-Exposure_fd, -deut_uptake_fd, -err_deut_uptake_fd) %>%
    filter(Exposure > time_0) %>%
    arrange(Start, End, State, Exposure) %>%
    select(ID, everything())

  attr(kin_dat, "time_100")= time_100
  
```

If FD is labeled differently, adjust the code.

Calculated kin_dat can be used in e.q.
[`HaDeX::plot_chiclet()`](https://hadexversum.github.io/HaDeX2/reference/plot_chiclet.md)
function. For more information check `vignette("code_usage")` article.

## HDeXaminer

We do not have much experience with HDeXaminer, but we encountered data
source labeled as HDeXaminer source in PRIDE. We want to discuss them
briefly.

If the file has following columns:

    #>  [1] "Protein State" "Deut Time"     "Experiment"    "Start"        
    #>  [5] "End"           "Sequence"      "Charge"        "Search RT"    
    #>  [9] "Actual RT"     "# Spectra"     "Peak Width"    "m/z Shift"    
    #> [13] "Max Inty"      "Exp Cent"      "Theor Cent"    "Score"        
    #> [17] "Cent Diff"     "# Deut"        "Deut %"        "Confidence"

it can be processed with
[`HaDeX::read_hdx()`](https://hadexversum.github.io/HaDeX2/reference/read_hdx.md)
from the code level, as it requires additional action from the user.
Then, this data can be used as described in other articles.

If the file has following columns:

    #>  [1] "Protein State"      "Protein"            "Start"             
    #>  [4] " End"               "Sequence"           "Peptide Mass"      
    #>  [7] "RT (min)"           "Deut Time (sec)"    "maxD"              
    #> [10] "Theor #D"           "#D"                 "%D"                
    #> [13] "Conf Interval (#D)" "#Rep"               "Confidence"        
    #> [16] "Stddev"             "p"

we can transform in directly into uptake dat in just a few steps. Keep
in mind that from this file format some information is missing (e.q.
uncertainty):

``` r
# select only necessary columns
dat <- dat[c(1:6, 8:12)]
# adjust column names
colnames(dat) <- c("State", "Protein", "Start", "End", "Sequence", "MHP",  "Exposure", "MaxUptake", "theo_deut_uptake", "deut_uptake", "frac_deut_uptake")
# change units
dat["Exposure"] <- dat["Exposure"]/60
dat["frac_deut_uptake"] <- dat["frac_deut_uptake"]/100

# add ID
peptide_list <- select(dat, Sequence, Start, End) %>%
  arrange(Start, End) %>%
  unique() %>%
  mutate(ID = 1:nrow(.))

kin_dat <- merge(dat, peptide_list, by = c("Sequence", "Start", "End")) %>%
  arrange(Start, End)

# mock uncertainty for plots
kin_dat["err_frac_deut_uptake"] <- 0
kin_dat["err_deut_uptake"] <- 0
```

then, when we have the uptake data, if can be used directly in HaDeX
workflow:

``` r
# select one state for classification 
kin_dat <- filter(kin_dat, State == unique(kin_dat[["State"]])[1] )

# show uptake dat in form of chiclet plot
plot_chiclet(kin_dat, fractional = FALSE)
```
