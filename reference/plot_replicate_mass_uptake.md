# Replicate mass uptake curve

Plot the mass uptake curve for selected peptide to see the difference
between replicates.

## Usage

``` r
plot_replicate_mass_uptake(
  dat,
  protein = dat[["Protein"]][1],
  state = dat[["State"]][1],
  sequence = dat[["Sequence"]][1],
  aggregated = FALSE,
  log_x = TRUE,
  interactive = getOption("hadex_use_interactive_plots")
)
```

## Arguments

- dat:

  data imported by the
  [`read_hdx`](https://hadexversum.github.io/HaDeX2/reference/read_hdx.md)
  function

- protein:

  selected protein

- state:

  selected biological state for given protein

- sequence:

  selected peptide sequence for given protein in given biological state

- aggregated:

  `logical`, indicator if presented data is aggregated on replicate
  level

- log_x:

  `logical`, indicator if the X axis values are transformed to log10

- interactive:

  `logical`, whether plot should have an interactive layer created with
  with ggiraph, which would add tooltips to the plot in an interactive
  display (HTML/Markdown documents or shiny app)

## Value

a [`ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html)
object.

## Details

The function `plot_replicate_mass_uptake` generates a plot showing the
mass uptake for selected protein in replicates of the experiments. The
values can be presented in two ways: as aggregated values for each
replicate, or before aggregation - measured values for charge values
within a replicate. The mass uptake is generated by subtracting the MHP
mass of a peptide from measured mass and the mass uptake is presented in
Daltons.

## Examples

``` r
plot_replicate_mass_uptake(alpha_dat)
#> Warning: NaNs produced

plot_replicate_mass_uptake(alpha_dat, aggregated = TRUE)
#> Warning: NaNs produced
